        <p class="entry-tagline">How casual shayari turned into more than fifty published anthologies.</p>

        <section class="entry-body">
            <p>
                There was a time when I scribbled poems and shayari just to impress girls and be different among friends
                with the entitlement of “Shayar”. Honestly, I was naive about my unique skill. In school, I recited my
                poems on stage and, by receiving applause from students and teachers, I fulfilled my ego without doubt.
                In those days, I was quite popular among girls, and that was enough for me. Steadily, I passed out of
                school as well as junior college, carrying only a vague vision of becoming a published author, with no
                clear plan or source to make it real.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the beginning of my graduation, my Hindi professor, Dr. Prerna Ubale ma’am, asked me to write a
                proper poem for the notice board and the college magazine. That is when I truly began to learn what
                poetry is. It became a turning point for my writing. I discovered new writers, new genres of poetry,
                different kinds of literature, and much more. Slowly, a new world of writing opened in front of me, each
                layer like a new realm to explore. I finally wrote a Hindi poem about friendship, “Yaara teri dosti…”,
                and from there I started exploring literature in English, Urdu, Sanskrit, Hindi and Marathi.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my final year of Bachelor of Arts, I began posting my poems on Instagram. One day, a message
                arrived from a stranger named Chandana Kashipuram. It was her first anthology as a compiler, and she
                invited me to write on “mother’s love”. With a full heart, I accepted and wrote an English poem titled
                “First Meet”. It was my first ever English poem, a couplet‑style piece that began with the lines about
                an ocean of love and a seashore of care.
            </p>

            <p>
                That anthology became my first published work under the pen name “Devil Barewar”, a name I still use for
                every piece of literature. Since then, the journey has grown far beyond that first invitation. Today, I
                stand as a co‑author of more than fifty published anthologies, each one a reminder that a casual shayari
                phase once quietly turned into a lifelong relationship with writing.
