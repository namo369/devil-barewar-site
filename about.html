                        <p class="lead">
                            I am Devil Barewar, a contemporary poet, storyteller, linguist, screenwriter and author from
                            Maharashtra, India. Over the last few years I have explored words in many forms – from short
                            poems scribbled in notebooks to full‑length stories and screen concepts that live on the
                            page
                            and on screen.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My writing moves between Hindi and English, often shifting easily from one language to
                            another
                            in the same piece. I am a co‑author of more than 50 books and anthologies, where my work has
                            appeared alongside writers from across the country. These projects have helped me sharpen my
                            voice and experiment with different styles while staying close to the emotions that matter
                            to me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Love, longing, distance and the everyday human struggle are at the core of almost everything
                            I
                            create. Sometimes the lines feel like a nazm, sometimes like a modern free‑verse piece, and
                            sometimes like a story being told to a close friend on a late‑night walk. I enjoy blending
                            modern images with classical rhythm, taking inspiration from old ghazals, folk tales and
                            contemporary life around me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Apart from poetry and stories, I also write screenplays and short film concepts. Visual
                            storytelling attracts me because it forces every scene, dialogue and silence to carry
                            weight.
                            I love thinking about how a line on paper will look and feel when it appears on the screen.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I am not writing, I am usually reading. I love discovering new poets and storytellers,
                            underlined lines from old books, and forgotten gems on dusty shelves. I often review what I
                            read, not as a critic, but as a fellow traveller who has just found a new story to share.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My interests are simple but strong: reading, writing, poetry and storytelling. Everything I
                            do
                            on this website – from poems and diaries to short films and essays – grows out of these four
                            habits and my wish to connect with people who feel the same way about words.
                        </p>
