                        There was a time when I scribbled poems and shayari just to impress girls and be different among
                        friends with the entitlement of “Shayar”. Honestly, I was naive about my unique skill. In
                        school, I recited my poems on stage and, by receiving applause from students and teachers, I
                        fulfilled my ego without doubt. In those days, I was quite popular among girls, and that was
                        enough for me. Steadily, I passed out of school as well as junior college, carrying only a vague
                        vision of becoming a published author, with no clear plan or source to make it real.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the beginning of my graduation, my Hindi professor, Dr. Prerna Ubale ma’am, asked me to write
                        a proper poem for the notice board and the college magazine. That is when I truly began to learn
                        what poetry is. It became a turning point for my writing. I discovered new writers, new genres
                        of poetry, different kinds of literature, and much more. Slowly, a new world of writing opened
                        in front of me, each layer like a new realm to explore. I finally wrote a Hindi poem about
                        friendship, “Yaara teri dosti…”, and from there I started exploring literature in English, Urdu,
                        Sanskrit, Hindi and Marathi.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During my final year of Bachelor of Arts, I began posting my poems on Instagram. One day, a
                        message arrived from a stranger named Chandana Kashipuram. It was her first anthology as a
                        compiler, and she invited me to write on “mother’s love”. With a full heart, I accepted and
                        wrote an English poem titled “First Meet”. It was my first ever English poem, a couplet‑style
                        piece that began with the lines about an ocean of love and a seashore of care.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That anthology became my first published work under the pen name “Devil Barewar”, a name I still
                        use for every piece of literature. Since then, the journey has grown far beyond that first
                        invitation. Today, I stand as a co‑author of more than fifty published anthologies, each one a
                        reminder that a casual shayari phase once quietly turned into a lifelong relationship with
                        writing.
