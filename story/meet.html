        <article class="story-body">
            <p>Sometimes unfortunates are God’s fortunate miracles. The monsoon days had just begun, the season of
                romance and love. These moments become even more auspicious when you live in the city of Pune, and for
                me, that night was especially unforgettable. It was a dark, rainy night. I was late from college and the
                clock was about to strike nine. I opened my black umbrella and started walking toward Shivajinagar
                railway station.</p>
            <p>Somehow, I reached the station. When I went to the ticket counter, it was already closed. Just then, I
                saw my train pull in on the opposite platform. Heart racing, I ran toward it. The train gave a horn to
                move, my heartbeat began to pound, and by the time I reached the other side, the train had picked up
                speed. I could not step inside. I missed it by a second.</p>
            <p>I asked the man standing behind me about the next train. He told me there would be no other train that
                night. Because of the rain, all other trains were cancelled and the one I had just missed was the last
                till Talegaon. My mood sank even lower.</p>
            <p>I sat on a nearby bench and looked at my clothes. They were splashed with mud. I went to the bathroom to
                clean them and then came back to the bench, wondering what to do next. That was when I noticed a woman
                standing in the corner with a black purse and a large blue trolley. I glanced at her face and froze. It
                was Neha Kolli. She looked worried about something. Old memories rushed back to me all at once.</p>
            <p>Pretending not to have seen her, I started looking around aimlessly. She walked over and sat on the bench
                next to me. I tried to hide my face, but my behaviour only made me look more foolish. Eventually, I
                stood up and began walking toward the station exit. I wanted to talk to her, but three years earlier she
                had broken up with me for no real reason and walked out of my life. Back then, my ego would not allow me
                to welcome her back.</p>
            <p>The rain started again. Suddenly, I sensed someone standing beside me. I turned, and there she was —
                Neha. I signalled to a taxi driver, and he pulled up in front of us. I asked him to take me to the bus
                station. He nodded, and I got into the back seat.</p>
            <p>As the driver started the taxi, I asked him to call that lady. Obeying, he shouted to Neha. At first she
                resisted, but finally she came over. She put her trolley in the boot and sat beside me in the back seat.
            </p>
            <p>Every moment in that taxi made me feel more restless. I tried hard to control my emotions. At last, we
                reached the bus station. I went to the enquiry counter, but no one was there, so I returned. Neha was
                sitting, talking on the phone. I stepped outside, trying to hide my feelings by staring at the rain.</p>
            <p>Then I heard my name. I turned and saw Neha standing behind me. Her beautiful face was right in front of
                mine. She looked as if she wanted to ask something, even though her lips remained closed. I found myself
                lost in her deep eyes. After a pause, she finally spoke. “How are you, Siddharth?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, absolutely fine,” I replied, and then asked, “How is your life going on?”</p>
            <p>Still gazing into my eyes, she answered softly, “Same as others.”</p>
            <p>I tried to keep my tone casual. “How is your husband? Is he a rich man?”</p>
            <p>“He is the best husband,” she said. “He cares for me, and he has a rich heart.”</p>
            <p>“But your eyes are saying something else,” I continued. “If he really cared, he wouldn’t send you all
                alone like this.”</p>
            <p>“He had a business meeting, that’s why I came alone,” she said. “And you are saying something too. Your
                eyes are saying one thing and your tongue something else.”</p>
            <p>“Leave it. Talk about something else,” I muttered, not wanting to expose my feelings.</p>
            <p>She asked quietly, “Did you miss me?” The moment I heard that question, my eyes grew heavy and tears
                slipped out. She said, “Please don’t miss me so much that I can’t forgive myself.” I could feel the
                weight in her voice. Everything around us seemed to fall silent. The breeze stopped along with the
                rumbling thunder. It felt like only two things were alive in that moment — her and me.</p>
            <p>“Why did you leave me?” I finally asked. “Today I am a professor at the university. I have a reputation,
                I have everything — except you.” At last, my heart began to speak.</p>
            <p>“I was helpless,” she replied. “Sometimes our destiny transforms everything — our dreams, our
                imagination. But my love was true.” Tears of emotion began to roll down her cheeks. The atmosphere felt
                so real and intense that it became one of the best moments of my life. No words were needed; the silence
                itself was loud enough.</p>
            <p>Just then, the bus arrived. I took her trolley and we both got on. She chose the window seat, and I sat
                beside her. Our journey to Talegaon began. We both remained silent the entire way, lost in our own
                thoughts, not caring about anything or anyone else. It was the most peaceful moment I had ever
                experienced.</p>
            <p>After an hour, we reached our destination and stepped off the bus.</p>
            <p>“Is somebody coming to receive you?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“Yes, my dad is coming,” she replied.</p>
            <p>“So how many days are you here?” I asked casually.</p>
            <p>“For two days. Mom’s health is critical, so I came to see her. And Siddharth can’t live without me for
                more than two days, so I have to return home quickly.”</p>
            <p>“Who Siddharth?” I asked in surprise.</p>
            <p>“My son Siddharth,” she smiled. Just then, her father arrived with the car. She picked up her trolley and
                said, “See you soon. Take care.” Then she left with them.</p>
            <p>I stood there, watching her go. And I could only watch...</p>
