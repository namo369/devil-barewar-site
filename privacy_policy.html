        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>Our website address is: <a href="https://devilbarewar.com" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://devilbarewar.com</a></p>

        <h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>

        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>When visitors leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form, as well as the
            visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help with spam detection.</p>

        <h3>Media</h3>
        <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF
            GPS). Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>

        <h3>Contact forms</h3>
        <p>If our site provides contact forms, the information you submit through those forms is used only to respond to
            your inquiry and provide support or information you requested.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>If you leave a comment on our site, you may opt in to saving your name, email address, and website in
            cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave
            another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
        <p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies.
            This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
        <p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display
            choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select
            “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will
            be removed.</p>
        <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes
            no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after one day.
        </p>

        <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (for example, videos, images, or articles). Embedded
            content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website
            directly.</p>
        <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor
            your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction if you have an account and
            are logged in to that website.</p>

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>We may use analytics tools to understand how visitors use the site so we can improve content and performance.
            These tools may use cookies and collect anonymized usage data such as pages visited, time spent on pages,
            and basic device information.</p>

        <h2>Who we share your data with</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. Data may be shared with service providers that help us operate the website
            (for example, hosting providers, analytics providers, or spam-detection services) only to the extent
            necessary for them to perform these services.</p>

        <h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
        <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This helps us recognize and
            approve any follow‑up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
        <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their
            user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot
            change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>

        <h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
        <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of
            the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that
            we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for
            administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>

        <h2>Where we send your data</h2>
        <p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>
